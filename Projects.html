     <p> Akshita has created only one major tech project till now which is her own portfolio. She has designed this specifically to get into GDSC, JIIT Noida. Here is the link <a href="index.html" target = "_main">Akshita's Portfolio.</a></p>
     <p> Akshita's another project is her youtube channel. Here is the link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ny_aBA0cMNY5vURQeRuKQ">Akshita's Youtube</a></p>
    P.S. : - I am ambitious enough to build more projects in the coming future and also to learn from them.
